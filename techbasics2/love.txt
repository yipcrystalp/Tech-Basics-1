Feisty Jupiter is in Scorpio, ruler of sex and intimacy, from October 10, 2017 until November 8, 2018.
 While outspoken Jupiter might awaken some evolved attitudes about love and sexuality,
 it can also spread some less savory stuff (like new strains of STDs).

On the other hand, progressive Jupiter, which rules publishing and higher learning,
could help reform outdated sex education programs.
Students might learn how babies are madeâ€”and also how to dismantle gender stereotyping,
protect privacy in the age of Snapchat and sexting,
and battle the pervasive rape culture.
Scorpio rules the psyche, so understanding human behavior and motivations 
could make a huge difference in safe, consensual enjoyment of our bodies and sexuality.
