Could peace finally come to our world—at least, in some small way?
 An awakening of higher consciousness and compassion might arise this spring,
 when cross-cultural ambassador Jupiter unites in a harmonious trine (120-degree angle)
 with soul-stirring Neptune in May of 2018. The duo will both be traveling through emotional
 and receptive water signs (Jupiter in Scorpio and Neptune in Pisces) most of the year,
 opening our hearts.

The exact trine will culminate on May 25, but they’ll be in close contact
from May until August. While we may be “divided” by cultures and nations, this rare
and unifying cycle reminds us that we are all one. Love has a banner moment with merging-minded
Scorpio and starry-eyed Pisces united.
