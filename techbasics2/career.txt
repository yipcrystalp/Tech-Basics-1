Get ready—the economy is going to go through some serious reforms in 2018.
Several of the outer planets will travel through signs related to finance,
power, corporations and shared resources, shifting the way business is conducted
in some fundamental ways.

Structured Saturn and shadowy Pluto will both spend the year in patriarchal Capricorn,
ruler of big business, banks, the government and hierarchy.
Saturn is here until December 2020,
while transformational Pluto is touring Capricorn from 2008 to 2024.
As these planetary power players
inch along in the same sign, we may see a rise in monopolies but also a crackdown on scandals.
Saturn is
the “integrity cop” of the cosmos, exposing shady business.
This year may also bring leaner times and corporate
cutbacks. However, old-school Saturn in hardworking Capricorn could revive a bootstrapping work ethic.
The Great Depression occurred while Saturn was in Capricorn from 1929 to 1932, and here’s hoping that we learn
from the mistakes of yesteryear.

Meanwhile, generous Jupiter hovers in Scorpio, the sign of joint ventures,
 mergers and pooled resources, until November.
The sharing economy may boom, possibly out of necessity,
as people look for creative ways to consolidate and cut costs.
Real estate and lending is ruled by Scorpio. Housing prices could soar, making it a seller’s market.
